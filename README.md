# Matplotlib Graphs

This is the link to the page of this [homework assignment](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2021fall/hw_02)

For this assignment, we interpreted data from .json files and converted them into graphs.

## Graph 1
This first graph is supposed to represent the amount of rainfall in the contiguous United States from the dating all the way back to 1895 and going up to 2016. I'm honestly not sure what happened to make the graph look like this but it is what it is at this point. Here is the orignal source of the [data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/national/time-series/110-pcp-ytd-12-1895-2016.json?base_prd=true&begbaseyear=1901&endbaseyear=2000).

## Graph 2
This graph represents the Gross Domestic Product(GDP) of the US vs China from 1960 to 2020. We can clearly see that the GDP of the US has been consistently higher than that of China. Here is the data sources for the [US](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/USA/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL?per_page=5000&format=json) and [China](http://api.worldbank.org/v2/countries/CHN/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL?per_page=5000&format=json).
